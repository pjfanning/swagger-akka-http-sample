# swagger-akka-http-sample

Clone this git repo and use `sbt run` to start the Akka Http server.

Uses [swagger-akka-http](https://github.com/swagger-akka-http/swagger-akka-http) which is built using [swagger.io](http://swagger.io/) libs.

Test using http://petstore.swagger.io/ and replace the swagger.json with http://localhost:12345/api-docs/swagger.json

The Swagger UI can be used to send sample requests.

Note that the sample now uses swagger-akka-http 0.10.0 which has some breaking [changes](https://github.com/swagger-akka-http/swagger-akka-http#breaking-changes-in-0100).
